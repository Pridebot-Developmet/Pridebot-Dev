Sexualities are typically categorized under two suffix categories: **-sexual** and **-romantic**. The suffix -sexual is the more common one and usually refers to an individual's sexual and physical attractions. The suffix -romantic is less common and is more often used if an individual's romantic/emotional attraction is different from their sexual/physical attraction. If someone's sexuality is the same for both sexual and romantic attraction, the romantic aspect is integrated into the -sexual suffix. Individuals can identify with more than one sexuality to more narrowly or specifically define their attractions. Sexualities are also some of the more fluid aspects of an individual's life as they can change or develop over time, so it's okay to be unsure; there's no need to rush: \n\nChoose one of the sexualities below that you want to learn about:`
